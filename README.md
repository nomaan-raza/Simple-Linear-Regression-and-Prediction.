What is Simple Linear Regression?

In statistics, simple linear regression is a linear regression model with a single explanatory variable.
In simple linear regression, we predict scores on one variable based on results on another.

The criteria variable Y is the variable we are predicting.
Predictor variable X is the variable using which we are making our predictions.

The prediction approach is known as simple regression as there is only one predictor variable.

Simple Linear Regression in machine learning with Python is a method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and a single independent variable by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

Linear Regression-

Linear regression uses the relationship between the data-points to draw a straight line through all them.
This line can be used to predict future values.
